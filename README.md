## Recommendations
* As for recommending additional services, I believe offering trading services on the Foreign Exchange Market - Forex.
* Not only would this new service increase membership acquistion and increase portfolio diversification, but would also make SoFi one of the first leading FinTech companies to implement this service.
* Utilities and tools used would forecast the Forex market for potential trades that can either be an automated or manual entry.
* Members who are not familiar with investing can learn efficiently through robo advisory and automated forecasting.
